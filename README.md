# DiamondFire Tools: Fabric Edition

This is a port of the DiamondFire Tools mod, which was originally made for Forge 1.12.2, this port aims to rewrite all the features so they can take advantage of new systems, such as the Brigadier system. Currently, the focus is to provide new GUIs in general, like one for /give and one that replaces the game menu.
