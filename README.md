# DiamondFire Tools: Fabric Edition

A new take of the original [DFTools](https://github.com/KSashaDF/DFTools) mod by K_Sasha, this mod ports some features from it while introducing new features like /dfgive! However, most of the important features from the original mod (like code templates) were reimplemented in DiamondFire itself thanks to the work of the new developers, so this mod attempts to go on a different path while still being helpful when needed. This mod is currently only available for the Fabric Loader, with [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) being required, the current maintained version is 1.15.2.
