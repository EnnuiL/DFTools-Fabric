# DFTools-Fabric
This is a port of the DiamondFire Tools mod, which was originally made for Forge, this port aims to rewrite all the systems so they can take advantage of new systems, such as the Brigadier system.<br>

Mod development has slowed down due to a bug where all item-related commands doesn't work until the inventory is opened.
